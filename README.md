# Breaking-Bad-Trivia-Website

I remember making this some time between 7th and 8th grade. It was one of the projects that I made for my web development class and I'm really proud of it. The code was lost for a while, but I was able to log back into my old account and find it. It felt strangely nostalgic looking at this stuff and the type of ideas that I came up with back then.

This is a little embarrassing, but heres the link to the site to play.
